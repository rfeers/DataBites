# DataBites
Hey there! Josep here from DataBites 👋🏻
Welcome to the official DataBites GitHub repo — a growing collection of simple, open-source code-alongs, exploratory data analyses (EDAs), and end-to-end data projects designed for learning, experimentation, and collaboration.

This repo complements my [DataBites Substack newsletter](https://www.databites.tech/), where I break down data science concepts, tools, and workflows with practical, hands-on examples. If you enjoy learning by doing, you're in the right place!


## What You'll Find Here 🧠
Each project in this repo is:

✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to follow
🔍 Inspired by real-world data problems
📎 Tied to a Substack article for added context and explanation
📁 Organized by category: code-alongs, EDAs, and full projects
